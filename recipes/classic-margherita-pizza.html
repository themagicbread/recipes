    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="gray-text">The Classic Margherita Pizza embodies the simplicity and perfection of authentic Italian cuisine. With a harmonious trio of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil, this pizza offers a burst of flavors that is both refreshing and satisfying. The high-temperature baking ensures a crispy crust that complements the melted cheese and the vibrant taste of the tomatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="gray-text">
        <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>8 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="gray-text">
        <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature (usually around 500°F or 260°C) and place a pizza stone inside if you have one.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet, then spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
        <li>Arrange the mozzarella slices on top of the sauce and drizzle with a little olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven. If using a baking sheet, place it in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, scatter fresh basil leaves over the top, and serve immediately.</li>
